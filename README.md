Why did you pick this API topic?
I picked this API topic bcause I feel like I have a lot of knowledge around this topic. This is because Conan Gray has been my favorite artist for years.

Describe your API and the available data endpoints
My API is about Conan Gray's songs and his albums. /sunsetseason would get all the songs and info and to get a specific song /albums/sunsetseason/# and replace the # with any number from 0-4, it would get you a song from the album. /kidkrow would get all the songs and info and to get a specific song /albums/kidkrow/# and replace the # with any number from 0-11, it would get you a song from the album. /superache to get all the songs and info and to get a specific song you can go to /albums/superache/# and replace the # with any number from 0-11, it would get you a song from the album. /foundheaven would get all the songs and info and to get a specific song you can go to /albums/foundheaven/# and replace the # with any number from 0-12, it would get you a song from the album.

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
I liked the experience building my own API server, because I had no idea what I was doing for my performance assessment in Unit 2, but I had complete control of what I was doing, so it was easier.
